I've been doing a lot of coursework and have some paid work done in machine learning now, but I haven't really taken the time to work on side projects. I've been working off and on on a few projects, this being one of them.

#Kaggle
I was originally introduced to Kaggle through a data analysis course in my Master's program. In case you aren't familiar, Kaggle is a platform for analytics competitions on which various companies and organizations post their datasets so that competitors compete to produce the best models. While I'm not so sure how I feel about the crowdsourcing approach to solving your problems for you, I think this is a valuable resource for sharpening your skills. 

#Random Acts of Pizza

#The Competition
The prompt for the competition is a rather interesting one. Using a collection of ~5000 posts and relevant meta-data from the subreddit /r/RandomActsOfPizza as described above, the competitors are to generate an algorithm to predict whether or not a user's post to the subreddit will result in a pizza or not. 

## The rest of this is in progress. I submitted a couple of naive classifiers, but to no avail really. I will update it as I progress.
