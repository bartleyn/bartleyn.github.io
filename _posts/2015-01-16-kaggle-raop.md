I've been doing a lot of coursework and have some paid work done in machine learning now, but I haven't really taken the time to work on side projects. I've been working off and on on a few projects, this being one of them.

#Kaggle
I was originally introduced to Kaggle through a data analysis course in my Master's program. In case you aren't familiar, Kaggle is a platform for analytics competitions on which various companies and organizations post their datasets so that competitors compete to produce the best models. While I'm not so sure how I feel about the crowdsourcing approach to solving your problems for you, I think this is a valuable resource for sharpening your skills. 
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
