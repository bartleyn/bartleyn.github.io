# Stories 

Stories are important, and I don't think that you need a fancy analytical framework to really understand that. I want to detail some examples and ideas about how stories and the transmission of information have helped me come to understand various, albeit inconsistent truths about the world.

To me, stories are an ephemeral thing and are usually tied to some sort of artistic medium: paintings, books, movies, TV, video games (yeah I said it), radio, the list goes on and on. Now these stories usually come from some sort of perspective on a topic and try to convey a lesson or idea to the receivers of the stories. Whether it's James Cameron's Avatar and its environmentalist message, or To Kill a Mockingbird and itâ€™s message about cultivating empathy, these stories are trying to share information. 

Now what if we relax the constraint that stories **only** appear in art?
