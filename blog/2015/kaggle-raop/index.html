I’ve been working off and on on a few projects, this being one of them.</p> <p>#Kaggle I was originally introduced to Kaggle through a data analysis course in my Master’s program. In case you aren’t familiar, Kaggle is a platform for analytics competitions on which various companies and organizations post their datasets so that competitors compete to produce the best models. While I’m not so sure how I feel about the crowdsourcing approach to solving your problems for you, I think this is a valuable resource for sharpening your skills.</p> <p>#Random Acts of Pizza</p> <p>#The Competition The prompt for the competition is a rather interesting one. Using a collection of ~5000 posts and relevant meta-data from the subreddit /r/RandomActsOfPizza as described above, the competitors are to generate an algorithm to predict whether or not a user’s post to the subreddit will result in a pizza or not.</p> <h2 id="the-rest-of-this-is-in-progress-i-submitted-a-couple-of-naive-classifiers-but-to-no-avail-really-i-will-update-it-as-i-progress">The rest of this is in progress. I submitted a couple of naive classifiers, but to no avail really. I will update it as I progress.</h2> </body></html>
