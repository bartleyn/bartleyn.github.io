As we get through the winter I will be updating the previous posts with details and some of my findings, but I wanted to clear up any confusion as to why the other posts are incomplete. A lot of these projects are ongoing or already have been completed, I just need the time to transfer the write-ups to the blog.</p> </body></html>
