            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My approach to teaching is centered on fostering critical thinking and practical application of theoretical concepts. I believe in creating multimodal and inclusive learning environments that encourage students to ask questions, engage in discussions, and apply their knowledge to real-world problems.</p>
            <p>Key aspects of my teaching philosophy include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encouraging active learning through hands-on projects and interactive discussions</li> 
                <li>Bridging the gap between theory and practice by incorporating real-world examples and case studies</li>
                <li>Adapting teaching methods to accommodate diverse learning styles and backgrounds</li>
                <li>Promoting collaboration and peer learning through group projects and study sessions</li>
            </ul>
